### Containers

Containers are modern ways of building and deploying software, instead of the traditional way of building for an environment. You build your code into a Container and move it to be deployed. This highly reduces the chance of encountering issues between environments, and it also speeds up the amount of time deploying software and microservices. You can use these Katacodas walkthrough for basic knowledge and understanding of Containers.

Task Requirements:
 - Read through the [Containers](/developer-foundation/containers) concepts page.
 - Create a <XLink to="https://www.katacoda.com/signup">Katacoda</XLink> Account.
 - Run [Docker Desktop](/enablement/prereqs) on your machine.

### Kubernetess

Kubernetes has become the defacto stander for managing Container orchestration. Since most enterprises build a rather complex and scalable systems, running a single container is not going to be helpful. Kubernetes helps manage all the complex parts of an enterprise system - from horizontally and vertically scaling enterprise to configuration management and health.These self-paced learning modules provides walkthrough of basic kubernetes tasks via Katacoda.Task Requirements:
 - Review [Kubernetes](/developer-foundation/kubernetes) Concept page.
 - Create a [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/signup) Account.
