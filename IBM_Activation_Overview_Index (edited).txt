## Pre Learning

Before working with Cloud-Native development, use this crafted enablement journey guide. It is important that you understand the basic concepts and developer tasks when working with Kubernetes or OpenShift. The following **Pre Learning** activities are highly encouraged to be completed if you have never seen or used a Kubernetes cluster for development before:

[Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) is an interactive learning and training platform for software developers. Each student is given access to a new environment without the need to install all the required component by themselves.

The pre learning is categorized into three areas:
-  **Cloud-Native Deployment** approach **Cloud**, **12 Factor Applications** and **Cloud-Native Development**.
-  **Cloud-Native Development** deployment using **Katacoda's**
-  **RedHat OpenShift Learning Katacoda's** to help you get familiar with the OpenShift platform and tools

Complete the **Katacodas** and read the background material before using the **IBM Partner Sandbox** agenda.
